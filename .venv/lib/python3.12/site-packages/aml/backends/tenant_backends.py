"""
GRAFOMEM tenant backends — the isolation spectrum (W5).

Three backends, all claiming {MULTI_TENANT, AUDIT} and sharing the same pinned
BGE store. They differ ONLY in which records a querying tenant is allowed to see
— which is exactly the point: each accepts a tenant_id on write and retrieve (the
type contract is identical and the MULTI_TENANT claim is honored at the API
surface), but the *isolation* contract diverges, and only the benchmark's
cross-tenant leakage / in-tenant recall checks tell them apart.

  - LeakyTenant   : stores each fact's owning tenant, but retrieve() ignores the
                    querying tenant and ranks over ALL tenants -> surfaces other
                    tenants' facts. Claims MULTI_TENANT, does not enforce it.
                    The tenancy analog of SoftDeleteBackend (claim != behavior).
                    Fails leakage.
  - TenantScoped  : retrieve() ranks only over the querying tenant's facts. No
                    cross-tenant leak; every in-tenant fact still reachable. The
                    correct one.
  - OverIsolating : scopes to the querying tenant AND hides any subject that
                    appears under more than one tenant ("ambiguous -> might
                    leak, so withhold"). An over-cautious privacy heuristic: no
                    leak, but it drops legitimate in-tenant facts. Because W5
                    shares every subject across tenants, in-tenant recall
                    craters — the tenancy analog of CoarseDeleteBackend.

The harness passes WriteOptions.tenant_id (the fact's owner) and
RetrieveOptions.tenant_id (the querying session's tenant) only to MULTI_TENANT
backends; the no-capability baseline (vector_only) sees tenant_id=None, pools all
tenants, and leaks. Requires grafomem[backends].
