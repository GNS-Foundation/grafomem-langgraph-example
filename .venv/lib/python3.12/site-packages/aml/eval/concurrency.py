"""
GRAFOMEM W10 outcome oracle — eval-layer, set-valued, backend-dependent (§10).

This is NOT the trace-side oracle. `aml.generator.oracle.derive_ground_truth`
answers a single-valued question — "given a trace with a total order, what is
THE ground truth?" — and is correct for W1-W9 because the order is fixed.

W10 has no such fixed answer. The permissible outcomes of a concurrency group
depend on the isolation level the *backend* declares (§10.2), which the trace
does not and must not know. So W10 ground truth is computed at EVAL time,
against the store under test — here, not in the oracle. The generator still
calls `derive_ground_truth` on the sequential prefix; the concurrent groups
live in `trace.concurrency_groups` and are evaluated by this module.

Model (option A — per-anomaly closed form). The three planted anomalies are
textbook patterns. Rather than enumerate every outcome set by hand, we encode
§10.2 as an anomaly LATTICE and derive permissibility from it:

    permissible(level) = { outcome : anomalies(outcome) ⊆ allowed(level) }

    allowed(read_committed) = {non_repeatable_read, lost_update, write_skew, phantom}
    allowed(snapshot)       = {write_skew, phantom}
    allowed(serializable)   = {}

Two consequences worth internalizing (both correct, both load-bearing):

  * An anomaly-FREE outcome is permissible at every level. An abort (first-
    committer-wins drops the loser) introduces no anomaly, so it is permissible
    even at serializable. Therefore the lost-update probe's permissible set is
    identical for serializable and snapshot — that probe separates
    read_committed from {snapshot, serializable}, and only the write-skew probe
    separates serializable from snapshot.

  * A probe yields an UPPER BOUND on a store's achieved level (the strongest
    level whose allowed-set covers what the store exhibited). A store's overall
    achieved level (§10.5) is the WEAKEST upper bound across all its probes —
    see `combine_achieved`.

Durable delete (§10.4) sits BELOW the lattice: a committed delete that a later
op resurrects is permissible at NO level. It is a hard violation, checked
separately from the anomaly classification.

The runner adapts a backend's `interface.ConcurrentResult` into an `Outcome`
(the `canonicalize` bridge lives with the runner, increment 6, since it reads
`interface.Memory`); the GroupSpec is extracted from `trace.ConcurrencyGroup` +
its turns/facts (the extractor is the generator's concern, increment 4). This
module consumes the abstract `Outcome`/`*Spec` so it stays testable in
isolation, with no dependency on backends or generated traces.
