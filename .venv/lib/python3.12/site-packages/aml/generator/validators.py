"""
GRAFOMEM trace validators — v0.1.1.

Independent re-checks of the V-rules in 01-workload-spec.md §7.3, plus
reference integrity, tenant isolation, and ground-truth consistency.

Design discipline: this module does NOT trust the oracle. It re-derives the
deletion ledger and introduction times from the raw turn stream itself, then
checks the trace's GroundTruth against that independent derivation. If the
oracle ever drifts from the spec, the validator catches the disagreement.
This is what a corpus-builder gates on before accepting a trace.

v0.1.1: active_memory is no longer serialized (trace v0.1.3), so V4 is now a
direct per-required-fact retrievability check (introduced / not-deleted /
valid / same-tenant) rather than a `requires ⊆ active_memory` set test. The
old ACTIVE soundness check is retired — there is no serialized active_memory
to audit, and re-deriving the full O(Q*F) set just to check it was wasteful.

Rules checked:
    V1  intra-turn disjointness (introduces ∩ deletes = ∅)
    V2  live-target deletion (delete only existing, not-already-deleted facts)
    V3  no dangling chain references in final facts; chains terminate
    V4  required facts retrievable (per-fact: introduced/not-deleted/valid/tenant)
    V5  deletion ledger is reproducible from the turn stream
    REF reference integrity (every fact_id resolves to known universe)
    TENANT  introduces don't cross tenant boundaries (W5)
    CONSISTENCY  recall_targets == requires

Returns ALL violations found (does not stop at the first), so a corpus
report can list everything wrong with a bad trace at once.
